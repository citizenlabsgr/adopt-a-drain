Adopt a Drain Grand River
Website Terms of Use Agreement
1.  Acceptance of Terms of Use
Grand Valley Metro Council (GVMC) and the sponsoring jurisdictions of City of East Grand Rapids, City of Grand Haven, City of Grand Rapids, Kent County Road Commission, Ottawa County Road Commission, Ottawa County Water Resources Commissioner, Plainfield Charter Township, City of Rockford, Village of Sparta, City of Walker and City of Wyoming (“GVMC & Sponsoring Jurisdictions”) provides the Adopt-a-Drain program ("AAD") to you subject to the following Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. By accessing and using AAD, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this Agreement.
2.  Description of Adopt-a-Drain
ADD is an initiative of GVMC & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions to encourage residents to clear out blocked storm drains. The AAD website allows users to "adopt" a storm drain, or state that you intend to help clear that storm drain out if it gets blocked by debris.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance AAD are covered by this Agreement.
3.  Obligations
If you choose to adopt a storm drain using the AAD website, you are under no obligation and have no responsibility to clear out the storm drain, or any storm drain. It is purely voluntary. However, user acknowledges that he/she may receive a “myGRcitypoints” reward code or other consideration in exchange for his/her participation.
4.  Termination of Obligations
If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, or GVMC & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, offensive, not current, or incomplete, GVMC & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the AAD services (or any portion thereof).
Accounts that consistently adopt storm drains without clearing them out may also be terminated.
Additionally, you agree that GVMC & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, limit your access to, or suspend your AAD service. Cause for such termination, limitation of access, or suspension shall include but not be limited to:
a.  breaches or violations of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements or guidelines,
b.  requests by law enforcement or other government agencies,
c.  discontinuance or material modification to AAD (or any part thereof),
d.  unexpected technical or security issues or problems,
e.  extended periods of inactivity,
f.  engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities.
Further, you agree that all terminations, limitations of access, and suspensions for cause shall be made in GVMC’s & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions’ sole discretion and that GVMC & the Sponsoring Jurisdictions shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account, any associated email address, or access to AAD.
5.  GVMC & Sponsoring Jurisdictions Public Records Policy
