**Project Description:**

The very broad goal is create an Adopt-a-Drain program for the Grand River watershed, covering nearly 3,000 square miles of land from just west of Lansing to Lake Michigan.

**Project Guides:**
* James W (Citizen Labs)
* Cara D (LGROW)
* Eileen B (LGROW)

**Maintainers (people with write access):**
* Dave W
* Ross H

## Data

Data is provided by Grand Valley Metropolitan Council's REGIS, or [Regional Geographic Information System](http://www.gvmc.org/regis/index.shtml). REGIS provides a common database, infrastructure, and suite of applications used for spatial data management by our members.  To facilitate a more informed decision making process, twenty cities, townships, and quasi-governmental organizations have joined together to develop REGIS, one of the largest local government multi-participant Geographic Information System (GIS) projects.
