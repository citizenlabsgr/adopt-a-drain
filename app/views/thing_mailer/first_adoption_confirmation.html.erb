    Dear <%= @user.name.split.first %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for adopting one of the Lower Grand River Watershed’s 40,000+ storm drains and
    keeping it free of leaves, snow, and debris! You are joining your neighbors in helping
    to protect the environment, manage stormwater, and minimize flooding.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">How to Care For Your Adopted Drain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Check the weather report weekly. If possible, clear leaves and debris off
      the drain before it starts raining and shovel snow off the drain in winter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove leaves, other natural materials, and trash. Compost if possible or
      dispose of them according to your community’s guidelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Did you find medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Toxic materials?
      Follow your community’s instructions for disposal guideline.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Never try to lift/remove the drain grate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear from the sidewalk or side of the road, not the street.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wear reflective clothing so vehicles can see you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always wear gloves and be careful of sharp objects!
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a rake, broom, or shovel if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dispose of waste appropriately. Visit <a href="https://www.lgrow.org/disposal">www.LGROW.org</a> to find out
