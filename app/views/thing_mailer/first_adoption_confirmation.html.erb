    Dear <%= @user.name.split.first %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for adopting one of the Lower Grand River Watershed’s storm drains and
    keeping it free of leaves, snow, and debris! You are joining your neighbors in helping
    to protect the environment, manage stormwater, and minimize flooding.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em; margin-top: 30px;">How to Care For Your Adopted Drain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Check the weather report weekly. If possible, clear leaves and debris off
      the drain before it starts raining and shovel snow off the drain in winter.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Remove leaves, other natural materials, and trash. Compost if possible or
      dispose of them according to your community’s guidelines.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Did you find medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Toxic materials?
      Follow your community’s instructions for disposal guidelines.

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em; margin-top: 30px;">Drain Cleaning Safety Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Please stay out of the street as much as possible.
      Place yourself in the right of way (the area between the
      sidewalk and the street) to clear the drain.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Always wear gloves and be careful of sharp objects!
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Use a rake, broom, or shovel to remove debris.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <u>Never</u> try to lift/remove the drain grate.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Wear light colored and/or reflective clothing so vehicles can see you.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      Dispose of waste appropriately. Visit <a href="https://www.lgrow.org/disposal">www.LGROW.org/disposal</a> to find out
